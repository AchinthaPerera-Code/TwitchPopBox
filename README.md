## Troubleshooting

- **Other Twitch extensions do not work in the chat?**
  - Extensions only run in top-level pages, not in iframes inside PiP windows. This is a browser security limitation.
- **Chat or video not visible in small windows?**
  - Use the toggle button to switch between them.
- **Extension not working?**
  - Make sure you are on a Twitch stream page and have allowed all required permissions.
